# Maze Generator

This program uses Wilsons algorithm to generate a maze and draws it using WinUi 3.
The width and height of the maze can be entered via command line arguments. The number of sides of the preferred polygon can be entered as well.
For example: "8 7 6" draws a maze with a width of '8', a height of '7' and is made out of hexagons.

Currently supported polygons are hexagons and rectangles.

The unit tests for testing the program are included in the files.
